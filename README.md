# Code Refactor Starter Code
Changed the title to better reflect the naming coinvention of webpage home screens
Changed the "li" lines to be more compact and not confusing to the eye.
Changed "hero" class to "background" class.
Changed the main classes to "consideration-points".
Merged classes of benefits together.


CSS changes
Within the styledsheet, I changed the classes "benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", and "benefit-cost" to condense. It was changed to reflect that they were similar. It was changed to reflect on the "h3" heading.
Changed some classes to better reflect consildation. Changing classes "search-engine-optimzation", "online-reputation-management", and "social-media-marketing" to reflect that they were the same to be stylistic changes on the "img" element.
^ Ditto, but to the h2 element
Condensed some classeds to "consideration-points". This allows the code to appear nicer and not repeating items.
removed the header div ul style type as it was superfloruos.
Condensed classes of benefits into "benefits for business".
element "p" is set to 16px, which is the defult for font. As such, removing this from the stylesheet does not incur changes.
In the stylesheet, remived the div and ul elements from the header. The only needed element was the li.
