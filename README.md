# Code Refactor Starter Code

## The changes made to the HTML code
In this file, it was necessary to condense the code to make it easier read for labeling needs, and accesibility. In this case, it was necessary to move some classes together and merge similar ones together. I have also changed the title from "website" to the name of the company so it would show on the browser tab heading.

The "li" elements were merged into the "ul" elements so they would be closer together which is easier to read, and not repeating unecssary amounts of code.

Replaced the class title of "hero" to background to better reflect a professional naming.

Condensed the classes of "search-engine-optimzation", "online-reputation-management", and "social-media-marketing" into "consideration-points" to shorten the amount of written code and to more easily read the code.

Merged "benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", and "benefit-cost" to condense.

## Changes made to the CSS stylesheet
Within the styledsheet, I changed the classes "benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", and "benefit-cost" to condense. It was changed to reflect that they were similar. It was changed to reflect on the "h3" heading.

Changed some classes to better reflect consildation. Changing classes "search-engine-optimzation", "online-reputation-management", and "social-media-marketing" to reflect that they were the same to be stylistic changes on the "img" element.

Changed some classes to better reflect consildation. Changing classes "search-engine-optimzation", "online-reputation-management", and "social-media-marketing" to reflect that they were the same to be stylistic changes on the "h2" element.

Condensed some classeds to "consideration-points". This allows the code to appear nicer and not repeating items.
removed the header div ul style type as it was superfloruos.

Condensed classes of benefits into "benefits for business".

Element "p" is set to 16px, which is the default for font. As such, removing this from the stylesheet does not incur changes.
In the stylesheet, remived the div and ul elements from the header. The only needed element was the "li".
